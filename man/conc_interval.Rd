\title{Generate credible interval for concentration analytically}
\usage{
conc_interval(cqs, model, level = 0.95, approximate = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cqs}{Numeric vector of Cq values from sample replicates, non-detects
coded as NaN}

\item{model}{esc object representing fitted model to use for estimation}

\item{level}{Desired credible level, defaults to 0.95}

\item{approximate}{logical. If TRUE (the default), a faster but potentially
less accurate approximation for the likelihood function will be used at high
concentrations}
}
\value{
conc_int object, containing a list interval specifying the lower and
upper bounds of desired credible interval, as well as the maximum likelihood
concentration estimate, and a data frame distribution, containing values of
the pdf and cdf of the posterior distribution evaluated at specified points
}
\description{
Given list of Cq values from a set of technical replicates and fitted ESC
model, generates credible interval of desired level through numerical
integration of the posterior distribution
}
