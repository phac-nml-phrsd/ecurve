\title{Estimate concentration from Cq values}
\usage{
conc_mle(cqs, model, approximate = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cqs}{Numeric vector of Cq values from sample replicates, non-detects
coded as NaN}

\item{model}{\code{esc} object representing fitted model to use for estimation.}

\item{approximate}{logical. If TRUE (the default), a faster but potentially
less accurate approximation for the likelihood function will be used at high
concentrations}
}
\value{
MLE of concentration
}
\description{
Given list of Cq values from a set of technical replicates and fitted ESC
model, generates maximum likelihood estimate of concentration
}
